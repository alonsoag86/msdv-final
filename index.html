            The latest U.S. Presidential Election delivered a shocking and
            unexpected outcome that profoundly shaped the political, social and
            economic landscape of the country. After the final result became
            official, many took this as an opportunity to explore and
            investigate what were the main reasons that could explain its
            unlikely conclusion. It is safe to say that this campaign had a
            profound impact in all of us.
          </p>
          <p>
            As we find ourselves in the middle of a fractured political
            landscape where we do not know for sure what are the consequences
            that it will generate, I want to take us back to the beginning and I
            want to share with you a view of the election through the eyes of
            one of its closest allies: Mexico.
          </p>
          <p>
            South of the Rio Grande, the bilateral relations between the U.S.
            and Mexico, have suffered a major drawback that has jeopardized
            years of close cooperation between the North American countries.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this historical turning point I was part of the international
            media analysis team of the former President of Mexico,
            <a

              >Enrique Peña Nieto.</a
            >
            On a daily basis and throughout the whole year, our team was in
            charge of monitoring over 200 media outlets from all over the world.
            We created and maintained a comprehensive database of all the news
            that were published about the country. This project is based on a
            subset of that database that covers 67 U.S. media outlets and 7,815
            articles.

            It is June 29, 2016 and your boss, the President Of Mexico, is
            meeting his counterparts of the U.S. and Canada in order to discuss
            the future of one of the most important trade agreements in the
            world. Part of your job consists on evaluating the tendency of the
            articles that you read. After a couple of months you start noticing
            trends and the tone of different media outlets. The example above is
            the headline of an article wrote by VICE. If you had to classify it,
            would you be able to say that this is a
            <span class="positive">positive</span>,
            <span class="negative">negative</span>,
            <span class="balanced">balanced</span>, or a merely
            <span class="informational">informational</span> article? It is hard
            to tell just by looking at the title. In order to label it, you
            would probably have to read the whole content.

                    Before the much-vaunted 'Three Amigos' summit even formally
                    begins on Wednesday, Canada, the United States, and Mexico
                    have already rattled off a string of agreements.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The tripartite conference between American President Barack
                    Obama, Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto and Prime
                    Minister Justin Trudeau — who is hosting the affair — is the
                    first time that Canada has played host to the annual summit
                    in a decade, and comes as Donald Trump, the presumptive
                    Republican nominee, takes sharper aim at the free trade deal
                    that underpins continental cooperation.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    By all accounts, though, the summit has already been pretty
                    productive.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The three are planning to sign a pact to draw 50 percent of
                    their electricity from renewable energy by 2025 — which is a
                    bit moot for Canada, which already generates most of its
                    power through "clean" sources — while Mexico has signed on
                    to a methane-fighting climate pact that Ottawa and
                    Washington already agreed to earlier this year.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Canada, meanwhile, has agreed to lift a visa requirement for
                    Mexican citizens in exchange for Mexico's removal of trade
                    barriers that prevented Canadian beef from entering the
                    country.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The clean-energy pact promises to be big business for
                    Canada, which is already setting itself up to be a huge
                    clean energy exporter to the United States. Trudeau, when he
                    was running for prime minister, repeatedly vowed to invest
                    in clean energy infrastructure.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    As of 2015, over 60 percent of Canada's electricity comes
                    from hydropower, with other renewable sources amounting to
                    about five percent.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Canada's energy surplus is worth about $4 billion in exports
                    to the US each year, and that number is expected to grow
                    significantly — especially thanks to agreements like the one
                    that will be signed on Wednesday.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    But while the three leaders, all of whom are self-styled
                    progressives, might be in relative consensus on climate
                    change mitigation, it's unclear just how much this summit
                    can do to bring the three countries closer together.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    With increasing focus on the human rights situation in
                    Mexico, Amnesty International is calling on Obama and
                    Trudeau to take a tough line on Peña Nieto when it comes to
                    police violence and police corruption.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    An Amnesty International report released to coincide with
                    the summit accuses Mexican military and police personnel of
                    employing sexual assault and torture against women in the
                    state's jails.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    "These women's stories paint an utterly shocking snapshot of
                    the level of torture against women in Mexico, even by local
                    standards. Sexual violence used as a form of torture seems
                    to have become a routine part of interrogations," Erika
                    Guevara-Rosas, Americas Director for the group, said in a
                    press release.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Trudeau, in a joint press conference with Peña Nieto on
                    Tuesday afternoon, said he and his Mexican counterpart
                    "discussed the need to uphold human rights, advance
                    democracy and the rule of law and ensure respect for
                    diversity as well as the ways in which we can work together
                    to achieve these important goals."
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    For Obama, this summit will be his last. If Republican
                    presumptive nominee Donald Trump succeeds him, it might be
                    the last Three Amigos, period. A Trump presidency would, if
                    he's taken at his word, mean a shedding of the North
                    American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the erecting of a
                    wall on the Mexican border, for which Mexico would pick up
                    the tab.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    "They're so used to having their own way," Trump said of
                    America's neighbors in a speech on Tuesday in which he vowed
                    to renegotiate NAFTA.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    "Not with Trump. They won't have their own way ... NAFTA was
                    the worst trade deal in the history — it's, like, the
                    history — of this country."
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Those provocative acts are sure to turn Ottawa and Mexico
                    City from friends to foes.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    But even Democratic likely nominee Hillary Clinton has gone
                    back-and-forth on whether she would ratify the Trans-Pacific
                    Partnership (an agreement that Canada and Mexico have both
                    pushed for) and whether she would re-open debate on NAFTA,
                    the free-trade zone encompassing Canada, the US and Mexico.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Trudeau wouldn't comment directly on the anti-trade rhetoric
                    that is appearing in the American election, except to say
                    that "we've seen around the world many examples of
                    protectionism, of concern, of stepping away from trade
                    agreements and engagements like we're showcasing today, and
                    I think it's important that allies and partners like Mexico
                    and Canada work together to address the challenges we're
                    facing together."
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    In advance of Obama's touch-down in Ottawa, huge sections of
                    Ottawa have been closed to the public, with security
                    dominating much of the capital's core.

            The negotiations of NAFTA were a major concern between the U.S.,
            Canada and Mexico during the campaign. In this particular article we
            can conclude that the three leaders achieved a positive consensus in
            terms of commerce, energy consumption and immigration policies.
            Nevertheless, the author of the article mentions the continuous
            problems that Mexico has been facing regarding the abuse of human
            rights, as well as the negative stance of the Republican Candidate
            on NAFTA. This was, in our team's eyes, a balanced article. How does

            The capture of Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán represented a major victory
